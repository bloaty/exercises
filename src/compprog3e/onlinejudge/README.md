Online Judge ([onlinejudge.org](https://onlinejudge.org)) is
a repository of competitive programming problems/exercises
from various sources. It looks like the site has recently
lost its academic sponsor and has fallen on hard times.

One must register to submit solutions. Java solutions must
be submitted using a very specific format.

- The program class must be a member of the default package.
  Delete the package declaration from the code snippets, if
  present.
- The program class must be called `Main` and have default
  visibility. Replace `public class Whatever {...}` with
  `class Main {...}`.
- To verify the solution, the arbiter expects to call a
  normal `main()` method, which can then normally invoke
  other methods, delegate to private classes, etc.
- Program input is provided directly via standard input.
  Output is sent directly to standard output. Solutions
  usually just read line by line from a
  `new java.util.Scanner(System.in)`. Problem text explains
  how to detect end of input, such as EOF or a special
  string.
